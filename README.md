## 🔍 About

A deep learning–powered tool to classify whether an individual may leave (e.g., churn or attrition) using behavior and demographic data.

---

## ✅ Features

- Configurable **ANN** with hyperparameter tuning via Jupyter notebooks.
- Interactive notebooks for regression analysis and model training.
- Real-time prediction via `app.py`.
- Log-based monitoring via `regressionlogs/`.
- Model versions stored in `models/`.

---

## 🧪 Dataset & Preprocessing

- The data resides in the `data/` folder.
- Includes steps for cleaning, encoding, scaling, and splitting.
- Preprocessed inside your Jupyter notebooks: `Experiments.ipynb`, `HyperParameter_Tunning_ANN.ipynb`.

---

## 🏗️ Model Architecture

- Multi-layer feed-forward neural network built with Keras/TensorFlow.
- Customizable layers, activation functions, optimizers, and hyperparameters.

---

## 📈 Experiments & Results

- **Experiments.ipynb**: Baseline performance and dataset insights.
- **HyperParameter_Tunning_ANN.ipynb**: Grid/random search to optimize model structure and settings.
- Visual performance metrics across epochs and configurations.
